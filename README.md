This repository contains my exercises for a JavaScript course. Each exercise is stored in a separate branch and deployed in main for GitHub pages until a new more robust and complete branch is made, then this branch will rebase the main branch. 
At the end, Iâ€™ll create a development branch that combines all resources from the other branches, which will then be merged into main.
